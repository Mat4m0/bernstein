For Apis mellifera alone, there are over 24 recognized subspecies or races. These subspecies have adapted to local environmental conditions and exhibit distinct physical and behavioral traits.\n\nIn addition to the Western honey bee (Apis mellifera), other species like Apis cerana, Apis dorsata, and Apis florea also have various races or subspecies, particularly in Asia where these species are native. However, the exact number of these subspecies is less well-documented compared to Apis mellifera.\n\nIt's important to note that the term \"race\" in biology can be somewhat ambiguous and is not always clearly defined. In the case of bees, it often refers to populations within a species that have distinct characteristics but are still capable of interbreeding with other populations of the same species.","x":11360,"y":-3190,"width":837,"height":480},
